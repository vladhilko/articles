# Introduction

Have you ever worked with a terrible developer? One who made your job more difficult and frustrating than it needed to be? Unfortunately, bad developers are out there, and it's important to be able to identify them. I've identified four critical factors that define a terrible developer, and this series will examine each of them:

- Lack of Collaboration
- **Lack of Growth**
- Lack of Big Picture Focus
- Lack of Passion

And in this article, we will discuss the second factor - Lack of Growth.

Imagine working alongside developers who shy away from learning, refuse to challenge themselves, and exhibit a fixed mindset. Such individuals not only hinder their own progress but also impact the growth of the entire team. Let's take a look at the key factors that contribute to stagnation in the software development field.
