# Introduction

Have you ever worked with a terrible developer? One who made your job more difficult and frustrating than it needed to be? Unfortunately, bad developers are out there, and it's important to be able to identify them. I've identified four critical factors that define a terrible developer, and this series will examine each of them:

- **Lack of Collaboration**
- Lack of Big Picture focus
- Lack of Growing
- Lack of Passion

And in this article, we will discuss the first factor - Lack of Collaboration.

# Lack of Collaboration

I have divided the article into four parts based on the following traits:

- Stubbornness
- Arrogance
- Stupidity
- Lack of Empathy

Let's discuss them one by one.

---

- ## Stubbornness

- **They always think that they know better than others** ❌

> David is a senior software developer who has been working on a project for several years. He believes that he knows more than anyone else on the team, and he constantly dismisses other team members' suggestions and ideas. Even when other team members present valid arguments and evidence to support their proposed solutions, David always insists on his own approach. This has led to conflicts within the team and a lack of collaboration, which has slowed down the project's progress. Furthermore, David's stubbornness has resulted in the team missing deadlines and delivering low-quality code. 

- **They have problems following simple agreements and style guides on your project** ❌

> Sarah is a software developer who has a habit of ignoring the agreed-upon style guides and conventions for their project. Despite being reminded multiple times by the team lead and other teammates, Sarah continues to write code that doesn't follow the guidelines, making it harder for others to read and understand.

> This creates a lot of frustration among the rest of the team, who have to spend extra time and effort reviewing Sarah's code and fixing any inconsistencies. When confronted about it, Sarah dismisses the importance of following style guides, saying things like 'I prefer my way of writing code' or 'I don't have time to waste on formatting.'

> This behavior not only slows down the team's progress but also creates tension and conflict among team members. It shows a lack of consideration for others' time and effort, and makes it harder for everyone to work together effectively.

- **They don't want to follow processes inside the team** ❌

> Jane is a software developer who consistently disregards team processes and procedures. She has been known to merge pull requests without waiting for approvals, deploy code outside of working hours, and skip QA testing. Her actions have resulted in several incidents where code was deployed to production with major bugs that could have been caught and fixed during the QA process. Her disregard for team processes has caused tension and frustration among her teammates, who are left to clean up the messes she creates. Furthermore, her actions undermine the trust and collaboration within the team, as other team members begin to question the effectiveness of the processes and whether they are necessary at all.

- ## Arrogance

- **They think highly of themselves and low of others** ❌

> John is a software developer who has been working in the industry for many years. He has a lot of experience and is very knowledgeable about coding. However, he has a tendency to think that he is the smartest person in the room and that others don't know as much as he does. When working on a project with his team, John often dismisses the ideas and contributions of his colleagues, believing that his way is the best way. He is quick to criticize the work of others, but becomes defensive and dismissive when his own work is questioned. This behavior has created a hostile work environment, with team members feeling undervalued and unappreciated. It has also led to a lack of collaboration, as John is not open to feedback and constructive criticism. As a result, the overall quality of the work has suffered.

- **They have a tendency to blame others for their own mistakes, they also tend to blame others for not understanding their code or solution. They don’t want to take responsibility for their code and their solution** ❌

> During a team meeting, Tom points out that a particular feature is not working correctly. He blames another team member for introducing the bug and insists that it is not his fault. However, upon further investigation, it is discovered that Tom had actually made a mistake in his own code that caused the issue. When confronted about this, he becomes defensive and insists that he did everything correctly and that it was not his fault. This behavior creates a toxic work environment where team members feel like they cannot trust Tom and are hesitant to work with him.

---

- ## Stupidity 

- **They want to reinvent the wheel every time instead of using existing solutions** ❌

> Sarah insists on creating a new library for a project, even though there are already established and well-maintained libraries available that could solve the same problem. When her teammates suggest using one of these existing solutions, Sarah insists that her approach is better and that it will save time in the long run. However, as the project progresses, Sarah's library proves to be less reliable and more time-consuming than the existing solutions. Her teammates become frustrated with the wasted time and effort, as well as Sarah's refusal to listen to their suggestions.

> This behavior is a red flag because it wastes time and resources, causing unnecessary delays and frustrations within the team. It also shows a lack of willingness to collaborate and work together towards a common goal.

- **They Make shitty code and when you offer help / criticize it they act as if you were the problem** ❌

> Samantha is a software developer who often writes poor quality code that is difficult for others to understand and maintain. When her colleagues try to offer constructive feedback or suggestions to improve the code, she becomes defensive and dismissive, insisting that her code is fine and that her colleagues just don't understand her approach. As a result of Samantha's behavior, her team's productivity and code quality suffered. Her colleagues were hesitant to offer feedback or suggestions, fearing her defensive and dismissive response. This ultimately led to a breakdown in communication and collaboration within the team, making it difficult to work together effectively.

- **They don't want to spend time finding the simplest solution or providing better and meaningful names in their code. They will tell you that it's a waste of time and doesn't matter as far as they understand it** ❌

> Sara is a software developer who values speed over everything else. She believes that the faster she can get a feature implemented, the better. Because of this, she doesn't take the time to think through the best approach to solving a problem or to ensure that her code is readable and understandable to others. When her colleagues suggest that she spend more time thinking about the best solution or that she provide better names for her variables and functions, Sara becomes defensive. She argues that her approach is perfectly fine and that the names she has chosen are good enough. She doesn't see the value in spending extra time on something that doesn't affect the functionality of the code. This attitude leads to frustration and confusion among her teammates. When they have to work with Sara's code, they often have a hard time understanding what it does or why it's structured the way it is. This slows down their own work and can lead to mistakes or bugs. Despite their feedback, Sara continues to prioritize speed over quality, making it difficult for the team to work collaboratively and effectively.

- ## Lack of empathy 

- **They always pick only the most interesting tasks and leave other teammates with something difficult and boring. They lack empathy and struggle to understand others' perspectives or feelings** ❌

> Emily is a software developer who always picks the most interesting tasks and leaves her teammates with the difficult and boring ones. She doesn't care about the impact this has on her colleagues and is solely focused on doing the tasks she enjoys. This lack of consideration for others can lead to resentment and tension within the team, as her colleagues feel undervalued and overworked. Additionally, her behavior can create a knowledge gap within the team, where only a few members have experience with the critical tasks, leading to a lack of redundancy and a single point of failure. Ultimately, Emily's lack of empathy can demotivate team members and lead to decreased morale and productivity.

- **They don't think about others and more junior team members. They would blame teammates for being stupid rather than reflecting on why their software can be bad** ❌

> John is a senior software developer who is highly regarded for his technical skills. However, he has a tendency to write code that is difficult for others to understand and follow. When his teammates ask for help or clarification, he responds impatiently and dismissively, saying things like "It's obvious, just read the code," or "I can't believe you don't understand this." John doesn't take the time to explain his thought process or reasoning, assuming that everyone should be able to keep up with him. This creates frustration and resentment among the team, especially for the more junior members who are still learning and growing in their roles. Despite the team's feedback that his code is hard to follow, John continues to write in his own style, without considering the impact on the rest of the team. This attitude leads to a lack of collaboration and communication, making it harder for the team to work effectively together. It also makes it more challenging for junior team members to learn and grow, as they struggle to understand the code and may not feel comfortable asking for help.

- **They don't want to share their knowledge with others or document it somewhere** ❌

> Tom is a software developer who has been working on a project for several months. He believes that everything he does is self-explanatory and doesn't see the point in documenting his work or sharing his knowledge with others. When his team members ask for his help, Tom responds with frustration, believing that their questions are a waste of time. He thinks that everything he does is obvious and that his teammates should be able to figure it out on their own. However, because Tom hasn't shared his knowledge or documented his work, his team members struggle to understand the code and make progress, leading to delays in project completion. Furthermore, when Tom is not available, no one else on the team has access to his expertise, and progress on the project comes to a halt. Tom's behavior creates a toxic work environment where team members feel belittled and unsupported.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, a lack of collaboration is a major red flag when it comes to identifying terrible developers. The traits of stubbornness, arrogance, and stupidity all contribute to a lack of collaboration, making it harder for teams to work together effectively. By being aware of these traits and addressing them head-on, we can help create a more collaborative and productive work environment.
