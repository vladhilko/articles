Form Object Pattern is beneficial for developers because it helps them to reduce complexity, improve readability, and make their code more maintainable. The Form Object Pattern also helps developers to simplify their controller code and reduce the amount of code duplication. Additionally, it helps developers to keep business logic separate from the controller code, making the application easier to maintain and debug.
The primary purpose of using the Form Object pattern is to manage the data associated with a form. It works by wrapping up all of the data related to the form into a single object. This object then becomes responsible for validating and processing the data. This makes it easier for developers to handle the data associated with a form without having to manage multiple controller actions.
Form Object pattern is a powerful tool for developers to use when developing web applications with Ruby on Rails. It is a design pattern used to encapsulate HTML forms and their related data in a single object, allowing developers to organize their code in a more structured and organized way.

In conclusion, the Form Object pattern is a powerful tool for developers to use when developing web applications with Ruby on Rails.
It helps developers to reduce complexity, improve readability, and make their code more maintainable.
Additionally, it helps developers to keep business logic separate from the controller code, making the application easier to maintain and debug.

Write 5 main point to use Service Object in Ruby on Rails.

1. Service objects can help to simplify complex business logic, making it easier to read, maintain, and extend.
2. Service objects can help to reduce code duplication and keep models thin by encapsulating business logic that does not belong in a model.
3. Service objects can help to reduce the number of queries made to the database, improving application performance.
4. Service objects can be used to encapsulate third-party API calls, making it easier to access and use external data within your application.
5. Service objects can be used to create a more consistent interface for interacting with different models, making it easier to switch out models without having to update multiple controllers.
6. Service objects can help to make code more testable and reduce the need for integration tests.
5. Service objects can help to keep controllers and views clean and focused, making them easier to read and maintain.
